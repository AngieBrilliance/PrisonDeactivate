# How to launch a flask app locally.

# This is a one page document on how to begin when launching a flask app locally.

# First Download Flask through the terminal.
#  -Make sure flask files are in the correct folder.

# Load a virtual envoronment
#  - A virtual environment is basically a protective sheild to launch the app without damaging your computer.

# Create a folder pertaining to the name of the app that you're launching.

# Activate flask within the terminal. (. flask/bin/activate)
   - It will create multiple flask files (bin, include, lib, local) within the folder you created.

# In order to turn your terminal into a flask command line enter: pip install flask

# Create two python scripts (run.py & config.py)
#  - run.py will launch the app, the script you write within it will look as follows:

	# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
	#!flask/bin/python

	from app import app
	app.run(debug=True)
 		 - (The T in True should be captalized)

# The config.py script will look as follows: 
	import os
	basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
  		- (Be sure to double the underscore on wach side of file.)

# Within the folder of your application you will also create a folder named app.

# Within the app folder you will also create two folders (Static & templates)
		- Static is a folder for CSS files and any images you may have. 
		- Templates is a folder for any html files you need for your app.
# 	If you've created HTML and CSS files for you application, now would be the time to move 	them into these folders. If you have not, save them into these folders. 
#	To establish a link between the HTML in your templates file and stylesheets(CSS) in your 	 static folder using the <link> tag within your HTML files within the <head> portion for 		your file. For ex:
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href= "{{ url_for('static', filename='stylesheet.css')}}"

# you will also create two python scripts (__init__.py & views.py)
		- Be sure to double the underscores in the __init__.py file.

# the __init__.py script will look as follows:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from flask import Flask
		                  (The second flask is capitalized intentionally.
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object('config')

from app import views.


# the views.py script will look as follows:
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from app import app
from flask import render_template

@app.route("/")
def index():
	return render_template('nameofyourapp.html')
				- in parenthesis should be the name of your html file.

# Do a last run through of all of your files and makes sure you have:
	- Double underscores when needed ex. (__file__)
	- All words capitalized when needed (from flask import Flask)
	- Everything is spelled correctly

# Now, in your flask terminal run your app with the command:
#		python run.py
#	Here you should see the local host url: 
#		ex. http://127.0.0.1:5000	

# Open up a internet browser and type in the url and see the magic happen.
